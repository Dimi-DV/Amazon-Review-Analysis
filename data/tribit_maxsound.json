Yet somehow that thing is still making sounds like it always has. I hate it. I want it to die so I can be justified in purchasing something that sounds much better. I decided I wasn't going to wait for it to die and was going to find a better sound and put this awful speaker out to pasture.I did a fair amount of research before purchasing the Tribit MaxSound bluetooth speaker. I was considering the Minirig 3, but many online audio forums kept steering me towards purchasing this Tribit MaxSound. Everyone said 'it has an even sound' with 'the right amount of bass'. They wrote that 'it gets loud without distortion'. They said it 'holds its own against speakers twice it's price'. These are all flat lies. This speaker hisses when it connects via bluetooth to my phone. It has the same volume and sound quality as my old SoundBlock from 8 years ago.To make sure I wasn't insane, I played Nadia Boulanger's piano piece 'Vers la vie nouvelle', first on my kid's echo dot and then on this speaker. The Echo dot sounded like a Bowers & Wilkins bookshelf speaker compared to this trash. This is inexcusable for an audio company to be making speakers in 2021 with this low level of quality."

I do find the extra bass feature is a requirement as without it bass is minimal. In fact, my only minor concern is the lack of really big bass like my old Sony that died after 10 months. But this Tribit really is perfectly adequate so I happily give it 5 stars.3 days later: I'm impressed with the consistent 18 hour battery life at moderate volume. And I stick with my 1st 5 star review. Mind you, this is not an expensive speaker. Tribit contacted me about my comments re the bass & offered to send me a return label AND a 20% off coupon to upgrade to their 360° XBoom. I'm going to take them up on this. I've dealt with Tribit customer service before & those folks still reign supreme!2 months later: I decided against moving up to the 360° XBoom.

Super annoying to turn speaker off, then wait, then back on, then re-pair with Bluetooth, when it’s advertised to provide up to 20 hrs of continuous playback.What’s worse is that when it first happens, you assume it’s a one-off. Don’t.I think in the interim that it’s just draining battery because there’s no way that I’ve gotten even close to 20 hours out of this and it has required charging already. I don’t even play it that loudly so it’s not really being taxed.  At all.At this point, this thing has cost me around $5 per time of turning it on.Currently: Would not recommend.

        "text": "UPDATED: I had checked some other reviews of different products from Tribit like Mega and Storm. They don't have the priority for aux port either. If you are an aux source user, avoid the products of this brand. Or waiting for a firmware update.This is a good Bluetooth speaker at a good price. It has long battery life and is water-resistant.However, there's a fatal problem that the aux audio does not have priority. This means that if you want to use it as a monitor speaker, you need to unpair all the Bluetooth devices first. Otherwise, after you plug in the aux cable, the speaker will still retry to connect with the cellphone many times andinterrupt sound from the aux source each time when it tries to connect. it drove me crazy.It's a good Bluetooth speaker but has this huge flaw with the aux source. I’d applied for a return."

You can also see they placed another barcode sticker on top of the old one.Don't advertise a product as new then send a used one. That's beyond unacceptable.I did test the speaker regardless to see if it's worth just getting a replacement. It's not.My biggest issue was the stereo mode not working when the speaker is charging. It only works on the \"hands free mode\" which makes the output audio sound like coming out from a $4 dollar store speaker.The audio itself when in stereo mode is not that impressive at all for the price. The \"Audiobook\" and \"XBass\" modes are useless. Pay a bit more (or even less) and get you a speaker from a more trusted brand. I won't mention the brand name explicitly, but it has the word Sound and Core in it :)"

I purchased it as a gift and when it was initially tried out, the sound was phenomenal.  Truthfully one of the better sounding speakers I've heard in a while.  HOWEVER, within only a week of use, this product stopped charging fully.  It would no longer play while charging and then, when unplugged, would be drained within only a few minutes of playback.  When I checked the battery meter, I found that the maximum charge it could attain was less than 40% of it's capacity.  Huge letdown regrettably.  Because it was a gift, I'm not trying to deal with the hassle/disappointment of a product that appears to be defective.  For this reason only (sound was great) I would not be able to recommend this product at this time."

After using couple days later on medium to high volumes that muffle started to develop more and then when i accidentally dropped the speaker from my hand for the first time it ended up sounding worse even at low levels.Since i did not get warranty for the speaker because it was imported by my seller, i thought of opening up and seeing it for my self, and then i noticed the black Adhesive Tape between the speakers sleeve like housing and front driver unit was stuck all over the place inside.After replacing the adhesive tape and sealing the unit properly its sounded way better and clear BUT at Full volume and XBASS ON i can hear it faintly, bass was still muffling. I Tried to use EQs to reduce bass @ 125Hz, it turns out that the speaker is using \"Volume Normalization\" which shows no real effect when changing EQs when played via bluetooth only.Audio delay in videos is quiet noticeable even with BL5.0 source devices but no problem when wired.Battery sucks big time when listening high volume and XBASS ON you get only around 3 hrs, just enough for one movie."
