        "text": "I've had 2 of these, the first I bought, used for awhile as a glorified computer speaker hooked to the AUX input.  It worked well for that purpose.  Once I tried using it as an actual bluetooth speaker... no good.  Bluetooth will repeatedly drop.  I tested with multiple devices of several brands (phones, tablets, even my laptop) and all had the issue.  I was ultimately refunded my money, but also sent another unit (in a different color, and different lot code so different batch).  Still the same issues.  As a wireless bluetooth speaker this just doesnt work.  5 songs if you are lucky but most of the time you can't get through a single song before it drops.  It's a shame as would have been nice had it worked."

It was solid had good weight looks good I love the green and black . Yah I really want to keep both. ( just to let you know where im coming from in this whole thing.I became diabled in 2019 been through five surgerys and still not getting better and unable to work. So zero income. When I got my stimulus check I really streched it as far as possible. And definatly wont wast money on something that does not work properly. ) I have gone through quite a few speakers and this one was looking really good right now and I was starting to imagine using them both in dual mode but then i turned it on and yes it sounded good until the bass. It hit hard but it was accompanied by a cracling / rattling sound I hoped it was the recording so I tried switching songs then I tried changing the EQ but the crackling was always there. So sadly I have to give one stare to a speaker I had reallly started getting excited about. I mean the bass is the main selling point eaven if the rest of the sound was crisp but there is nothing you can do about the bass. You know the sound of your friends priemium car stereo when the base hits so hard everything rattles it was much the same. It was sitting on the carpet with nothing touching it so im guessing it was most likely an improperly assembled speaker. In my disapointment I decided to return them both I did not want to return the other one as used also so I did not charge it and compare. But looking back if I had tested it and it worked properly I would probably have kept it and given a better rating. So just treat this review as cautionary."

        "text": "Ordered a W King D8 in 2019, and based on other reviews, must have been sent a defective product. I would have returned it, but it sat unopened for about 2 months after i bought it. Absolutely no bass response no matter how or where I positioned it. To say it had a thin, tinny sound would be a compliment. I am truck driver, and wanted something with decent sound quality to use in the cab at night. Our trucks are all new, top of the line, so fairly quiet. At 80 percent volume, less than 2 feet from my head, I could not make out what song was even playing on this thing with the truck idling. Over 80 percent, it distorts so badly you cant tell whats playing anyway. As a lifelong musician and audiophile, I know how to get a good sound out of my equipment, even decent sound out of poor equipment. No matter how i tweaked this thing, the best sound i could get was on par with an AM radio being played through a bullhorn. My phone speaker SOUNDS BETTER and is LOUDER. Gave it to my daughter after she saw it sitting around and asked about it. She ended up throwing it away because she couldnt hear it over the shower or when walking if it was windy at all, and she had no other use for it. My son has a $10-15 speaker (i-room I think?) that sounds 10 times better than this, and is louder. Could have been a defective unit i guess, but I do not recommend wasting your money to find out."

The first one didn't work it wouldn't connect or turn off once it was on so I returned it and they exchanged it, when the second one arrived I was able to pair 2 together and they worked really well for a few month. The sound with both of them together is really nice, u can feel the bass on your body if you walk between them so I love that, but it didn't last for long because after sometime one of the speakers would connect and it started doing what the previous one did, once it was one u can't turn it off or reset to connect to the Bluetooth. So now I have one working speaking and one bad one. And I can no longer return or exchange because I'm out of my return window. So DON'T SPEND THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT WILL ONLY WORK FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS."

I have used them very well. Even taken them camping and use the for outdoor events. The batteries are still going strong. The sound is amazing, considering the size, and cheaper than these King of Craps. Was looking for better sound quality and higher quality db‚Äôs.Not here ... stay away from these budget speakers. Period. Best Buy has a whole row of these things and will price match. Listening to them you can tell that ever manufacture has their niche ... I went with JBL ... but I am biased because I have JL in both my home and car. It‚Äôs worth the money out of pocket. If you are on a budget I highly recommend the ooz angle 3‚Äôs.Pros: They connected wellShipped fastVery well packagedCharged fastCons: Sound quality is horrible! At any volume. At any eq. Just totally horrible!They are heavy and hard to move around.They are plain green and ugly tbh. The plastic mold is tacky and cheap.Battery drain is much faster than advertised.Conclusion: in a consumer world you get what you pay for. There are literally 100‚Äôs of the same products online that are made in China and all of them are money pits. Invest your money in good sound. Go to Best Buy or your local shop and listen to well established products if you can.Hope this helps everyone! Cheers! To good sound! (AKA: you are not gonna find it on Amazon)"

The speaker will no longer turn on and is completely useless.  The battery level indicator lights all light up, but the speakers power switch has lost its 'click'. Considering this has spent the entire time I've owned sitting on a shelf INSIDE THE CAB of a large truck, never being carried or tossed around, that's pretty pathetic.  The unit is otherwise in perfect condition, but has now become an $70 paperweight.I have NO intention of even wasting my time trying to get support from an off brand company like this, which will probably just turn into even more aggravation.

It has considerable weight. For those wondering about the overall size of the unit, it's about the size of a loaf of sliced bread.On to the BAD. It goes out of sync with the video on EVERY source I've tried it with including a Win 10 PC, several Android devices and an iPod. I don't get it. No other BT speaker I've owned has ever had this issue. It's SUPER annoying and the only remedy I've found is to power cycle the speaker. This has to be done every 10 min or so, or whenever you can't take the lack of sync becomes too much to tolerate.If you're gonna use it to watch movies, YouTube vids, etc, be prepared for a VERY annoying experience.....Or just avoid this one and find a brand/model that doesn't have A/V sync issues."
